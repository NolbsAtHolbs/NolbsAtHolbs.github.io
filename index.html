			<p>
				A game where the user fixes their gaze on an object and tries to maintain focus on that object while it is moving.
				The camera tracks their eyes and gives feedback in real time, depending on the focus of their gaze.
				This is called focal fixation therapy. It can be used to help people improve their concentration.
